    "audio.wav": "The quiet night gathers my scattered thoughts. Moonlight drifts across the empty road. Streetlights hum like distant memories. And shadows stretch where silence grows. I walk alone but never empty. Carrying questions I never chose, Until the dawn begins its whisper. And turns my doubts to something close."
